# First-React-App
This is my first React application that allows users to enter tasks and display them in a list. Each task can be deleted individually.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to learn and practice building a simple React application. It focuses on fundamental concepts such as state management, handling user input, and rendering components.

## Features
- User can enter tasks into an input field.
- Submitted tasks are displayed in a list.
- Each task has a corresponding "Delete" button to remove it from the list.

## Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- JSX: A syntax extension for embedding HTML-like code within JavaScript.
- useState: A React hook for managing state.
- CSS: Styling the components.

## Usage
1. Enter a task into the input field.
2. Click the "Submit" button to add the task to the list.
3. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to it.
